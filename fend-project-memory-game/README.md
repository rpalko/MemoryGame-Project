Memory Game!

This is a quick, easy, and fun game that has the user searching through the flipped over cards for their matches.
The user starts the game by clicking on the start button in the top left-hand corner.
Once the user finds all matches a window will pop up with all of the game statistics, and the user will be given the option to reset the game and try again!
